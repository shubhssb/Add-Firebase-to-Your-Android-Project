If you would like to integrate the Firebase libraries into one of your own projects,
you need to perform a few basic tasks to prepare your Android Studio project.
You may have already done this as part of adding Firebase to your app.

First, add rules to your root-level build.gradle file, to include the google-services plugin:

buildscript {
    // ...
    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
    }
}
Then, in your module Gradle file (usually the app/build.gradle), add the apply plugin line at the bottom of the file to enable the Gradle plugin:

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
  // ...
}

dependencies {
  // ...
  compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:9.4.0'
}

// ADD THIS AT THE BOTTOM
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
You should also add the dependencies for the Firebase SDKs you wish to use - we recommend starting with the firebase-core, which include Firebase Analytics, but see below for the full list.

Note: If you want to know more about what the Gradle plugin does, see our Google Services Gradle Plugin guide
