# Add-Firebase-to-Your-Android-Project

Prerequisites

A device running Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or newer, and Google Play services 9.4.0 or newer
The Google Play services SDK from the Android SDK Manager
Android Studio 1.5 or higher
An Android Studio project and its package name

isssue:<<<<Instant Run in Android Studio prior to version 2.2 is incompatible with Firebase Analytics and prevents certain events from being collected. We recommend either disabling instant run or upgrading to the Android Studio 2.2 preview.>>>>

If you don't have an Android Studio project already, you can download one of our quickstart samples if you just want to try a Firebase feature. If you're using a quickstart, remember to get the package name from the ApplicationManifest.xml, you'll need it for the next step.

Note: If you are upgrading from a 2.X version of the Firebase SDK, see our upgrade guide for Android to get started.
